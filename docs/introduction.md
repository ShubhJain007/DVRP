# Introduction

The **Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP)** addresses the challenge of routing vehicles dynamically in response to real-time events. This repository presents a simulation-based approach leveraging the ICAPS baseline model (DRLSA) for optimized routing.

## Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Routing**: Real-time adjustments to vehicle routes based on new data.
- **Travel Time Matrix**: Pre-computed travel times between all points in the network.
- **Demand Models**: Simulated customer demand for testing routing strategies.

For more theoretical background, refer to the project's main paper.
