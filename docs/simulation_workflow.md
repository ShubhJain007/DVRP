# Simulation Workflow

The simulation process involves the following steps:

## 1. Data Preparation
- Process raw trip data to generate usable datasets.
- Create a travel time matrix for routing simulations.

## 2. Simulation Execution
- Execute the `sim_proc.jl` script to simulate vehicle routing scenarios.
- Monitor real-time outputs in the console.

## 3. Analyze Results
- Review output files in the `results/` directory.
- Use the `dataprep/paper_figs.ipynb` notebook to generate performance visuals.

Refer to the [Usage Guide](usage_examples.md) for hands-on examples.
